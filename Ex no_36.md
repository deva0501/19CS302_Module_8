# # #Task - Hackerrank Problem

This challenge requires you to print Hello Saveetha! on a single line, and then print the already provided input string to stdout. If you are not familiar with C, you may want to read about the printf() command.

# # Example:

Saveetha

The required output is: Hello, Saveetha! C Programming

To write a C program to print Hello Saveetha! on a single line, and then print the already provided input string to stdout.

Algorithm
1.Start the program and declare a character array to store the input string.

2.Use gets() or fgets() to read a line of input from the user.

3.Print "Hello Saveetha!" on the first line.

4.Print the user-provided input string on the next line.

5.End the program.

Program:
/*
C program to find the smallest among three numbers using Structure.
*/
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    char input[100];

    fgets(input, sizeof(input), stdin);

    printf("Hello Saveetha!\n");
    printf("%s", input);

    return 0;
}



Output:

<img width="444" height="231" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f597581-df4a-4383-9f14-3b8aee6b2261" />


Result:
Thus the program was executed and the output was verified successfully.
